Hi there!

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** based in Cape Town, South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

Software has been eating the world for a while now, but there's so much left to build: So I've been working for the past 10 years as a Full Stack Developer, Software Architect & Founder, trying to gain as much experience as possible building startups that solve every-day problems using software.

My favourite tools are: **PostgreSQL**, **Elixir**, **Tailwind**, **GraphQL**, **Python** & **Flutter**.
