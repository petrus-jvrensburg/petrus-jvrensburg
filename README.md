Hi there!

I'm a **Full Stack Engineer** based in Cape Town, South Africa ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦

Software has been eating the world for a while, but there's so much left to build: I have **10 years experience** as a Full Stack Developer / Software Architect & Founder, working to build software startups to solve people's every-day problems.

My favourite tools are: **PostgreSQL**, **Elixir**, **Tailwind**, **GraphQL**, **Python** & **Flutter**.
